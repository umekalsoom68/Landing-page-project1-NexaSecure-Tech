## 📌 About The Project

This is my **Week 1 project** during my **1-Month Frontend Development Internship** at **NexaSecure Tech**.

I built a fully responsive **Landing Page** for **Home Fit Ware** — a Pakistani footwear brand — using only **HTML & CSS** from scratch. The design follows a traditional Pakistani vibrant theme with **Red & Gold** colors, Mughal-inspired elements, and smooth animations.
